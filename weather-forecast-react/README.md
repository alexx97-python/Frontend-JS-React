Main Information
This project works fine on browsers Microsoft Edge and Fireforox. However, it contains a bug with Google Chrome. The response for my request of location differs and I guess it is the main problem. I wasn't be able to fix it in time but I will continue study this subject.

The optimization of request were made by using LocalStorage and also, for options buttons I used additional sate storage in order to cut the main one in pieces the way user requests.(Today, tommorow, 3 days)

In order to get information of location you want you should provide the whole city name and the abreviation of country, like (Paris-FR, London-UK, Berlin-GE...). It works fine, till the moment it can't find the right response. This also should be fixed.

For the whole project I spent almost 20 hours as I really struggled with bug in browser Google Chrome.
